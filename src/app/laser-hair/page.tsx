        <h2 className={styles.laserHairSectionHeading}>Preparation for Your Elysion Treatment</h2>
        <p className={styles.laserHairContentText}>
          To ensure the best possible results from your Elysion hair removal treatment in McMinnville, a little preparation is key. Firstly, shave the treatment area 24 hours before your session; this allows the laser to target the hair follicle more effectively. Avoid sun exposure, tanning beds, and self-tanning products for at least two weeks prior to treatment, as tanned skin can affect the effectiveness of the laser. It’s also advisable to stay hydrated and avoid caffeine on the day of your appointment to enhance your skin’s response to the treatment. Finally, arrive at your session with clean skin, free of lotions, creams, or makeup in the targeted areas.

        <p className={styles.laserHairContentText}>
          After your Elysion session, a few simple steps will help maintain your results and ensure a comfortable recovery. It’s normal to experience slight redness; applying a cool compress can provide relief. Avoid direct sun exposure and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen to protect the treated area. Steer clear of hot baths, saunas, and intense exercise for 24 hours post-treatment. If you have any concerns or questions after your session, our team is always here to provide guidance and support.
